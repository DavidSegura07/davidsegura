This is my life's work.

Hi, My name is David Segura and today is the day I become more then I dream to be. It's May 30 2023 and its my birthday. This is the poorest Ive been and the most happiest. About a month and half got i got let go by a company that Ive been working for nearly 10 years. My bussiness has been burning to the ground since covid and im the most proudest. This year i found my voice, the voice to fight. The same voice that told me this is the year you climb that mountain. So Cheers to the big 31. May all that happens this year be nothing but blessing and good vibrations.
